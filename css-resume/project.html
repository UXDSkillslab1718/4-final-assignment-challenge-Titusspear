            <h2>Design for Emotion</h2>

       
            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>In this project we had to explore the significance of emotion in creating an engaging user experience through creative research and explorative design. We had to gain insights into the nature of emotion and why emotions are important in creating a meaningful relationship and dialog between a user and an interactive product.</p>
            
          
            <h3>Our concept</h3>
            <p>The idea that my group came up with was to create a virtual assistant that helps people with their productivity and motivation, and the aim was to use humour, frustration, and annoyance as input from the assistant to try and persuade or motivate the user to be more productive.</p>
